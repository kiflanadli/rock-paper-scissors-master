## My process

### Built with

- React js
- SCSS
- Localstorage
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Personal notes

There is some responsiveness issue when the page being view with desktop screen (> 1400px width), the layout isn't vertically centered enough. So I'd like to improve those in the future using ways such as flex column.
